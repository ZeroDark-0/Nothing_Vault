Here ==GitHub== is a website which help us to upload, fork, collaborate and other things.
Where else ==Git== is  main source for the file and the code we upload on the GitHub.

The commit are like a check point where we came back if something goes wrong or use them as the history resource.

Now the branches -
The main branch is the Master branch where the main source of the code exist.
And next thing is the alternate branch, this mean like a clone of the master branch in which you can edit anything without messing around the Master branch. And for the alternate branch we can push it to master branch.
