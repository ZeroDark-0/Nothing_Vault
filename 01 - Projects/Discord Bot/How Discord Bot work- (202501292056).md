Mainly languages we can use to make a discord bot are -
### <code style = "color:cyan">Languages -</code>
### 1️⃣ **Python** 

✅ Easy to learn & great for beginners  
✅ `discord.py` library (most popular)  
✅ Great for AI, automation, and quick scripts  
🚀 Best for **AI bots, automation bots, utility bots**

### 2️⃣ **JavaScript (Node.js)** 

✅ `discord.js` library (most popular for JS)  
✅ Asynchronous & efficient  
✅ Best for real-time bots (gaming, music, etc.)  
🚀 Best for **gaming bots, real-time bots, high-performance bots**

### 3️⃣ **TypeScript** 

✅ Strongly typed version of JavaScript  
✅ Works with `discord.js`  
✅ Good for large-scale projects  
🚀 Best for **enterprise-level bots, structured projects**

### 4️⃣ **Go (Golang)** 

✅ Fast & lightweight  
✅ `discordgo` library  
✅ Best for high-performance bots  
🚀 Best for **moderation bots, stat-tracking bots**

---

## **Other Supported Languages**

These languages are less common but still work for Discord bots:

### 5️⃣ **Java** 

✅ `JDA` (Java Discord API)  
✅ Strong multithreading support  
🚀 Best for **complex, large-scale bots**

### 6️⃣ **C# (.NET)** 

✅ `DSharpPlus` and `Discord.Net` libraries  
✅ Great for Windows-based apps  
🚀 Best for **game-related bots, Windows integration**

### 7️⃣ **Rust** 

✅ High performance and memory safety  
✅ `serenity` library  
🚀 Best for **low-latency bots, security-focused bots**

### 8️⃣ **C++** 

✅ Very fast & efficient  
✅ Requires manual handling of the API  
🚀 Best for **high-performance, low-latency bots**

## **🟢 Experimental & Unique Choices**

### 9️⃣ **PHP** – `DiscordPHP` (Not widely used, but possible)

### 🔟 **Ruby** – `discordrb` (Good for small bots)

### 1️⃣1️⃣ **Swift** – Rare but possible for Apple-based systems

### 1️⃣2️⃣ **Kotlin** – Works with JDA (Java wrapper)

---

For Understanding - 

- **Beginner** → Python (`discord.py`)
- **Web developer** → JavaScript (`discord.js`)
- **Need high performance** → Go or Rust
- **Building a complex bot** → Java or C#

### <code style = "color:cyan">How it work -</code>

## ➡️ Bot Creation and Authentication

   - Go to  [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Creating a application and bot token
   - Add it to a server

## ➡️ Connection Discord API

   - Th bot connect through a ==WebSockets==
   - It's listen to the live messages, reaction, or new members
   - The bot itself authenticates itself using bot token 

## ➡️ Handling Events{Listening and responding}

- `on_ready()` → Runs when the bot is online.
- `on_message()` → Triggers when a user sends a message.
- `on_reaction_add()` → Detects when a user adds a reaction

## ➡️ Using Commands {API requests}

- Commands are triggered with a **prefix** (`!help`, `!ban`, `!weather`).
- The bot processes the command and sends a **response using REST API calls**.

## ➡️ Some Advanced Features

  1. Database Storage -
     - Storing the data, points, setting in -Sqlite or MongoDB, or Firebase
  2. AI and API Integration -
     - Add **GPT-4 for AI chat** or **OpenWeather API for weather updates**.
   

## ➡️ Hosting the Bot (24/7)

   - Uploading the code on [Replit](https://replit.com) 
   - Using `keep_alive.py` from preventing the shutdown.
   - or using amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean
