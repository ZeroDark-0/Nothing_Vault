## Poll and voting bot and point system where people launch a poll against user where if the voting surpass a threshold it will drop the rating for that user (can manually add ban/mute/ or other things) 



# Main idea

By combining a **point system** with **moderation** through **community voting**, it can help foster a more engaging and accountable atmosphere in the server. Here's how you might want to structure it:

---

### **Key Features of the Bot:**

1. **Point System:**
    
    - Users earn points by **actively participating** (e.g., messaging in text channels). You could set thresholds based on message activity.
    - For example: `+1 point` for every 5 messages sent, or `+1 point` for every 10 minutes of active engagement.
2. **Voting System:**
    
    - **Moderators or members** can **initiate a vote** to assess a user‚Äôs behavior. This vote can be initiated if someone reports bad behavior (e.g., harassment, spamming, etc.).
    - Voting threshold can be set, e.g., **60% of users** need to vote "Yes" to approve the punishment.
    - The vote could be something like, ‚ÄúShould this user be penalized for spamming?‚Äù
3. **Point Deduction:**
    
    - If the vote passes the threshold, the bot deducts a **percentage of the user‚Äôs points**.
    - The **percentage** of points deducted could be set by the **moderators** (e.g., 10%, 20%, etc.).
4. **Warnings and Bans:**
    
    - **Warnings:** The bot can send a direct message or post in a public channel, informing the user of their **warning** and the behavior they need to improve.
    - **Ban:** If the point deduction crosses a certain threshold, the bot could automatically **ban** the user, or issue a **temporary ban** depending on your server‚Äôs rules.

---

### **Possible Commands:**

1. **Point System:**
    
    - `!points @user` - Shows a user's current points.
    - `!addpoints @user [amount]` - Add points to a user for good behavior (e.g., event participation).
    - `!deductpoints @user [amount]` - Deduct points manually for certain infractions (e.g., a user abuses the bot).
2. **Vote System:**
    
    - `!report @user [reason]` - Initiates a vote to decide if a user should be penalized.
    - `!vote yes/no` - Voting command to vote for or against the user.
    - `!votestatus` - Shows the current status of the vote (how many votes "yes," how many "no").
3. **Mod Actions:**
    
    - `!setpointthreshold [percentage]` - Set the percentage of points to be deducted on a successful vote.
    - `!setbanthreshold [points]` - Set the points threshold at which the bot will ban a user.
4. **Warnings/Bans:**
    
    - `!warn @user [reason]` - Give the user a formal warning via DM or public message.
    - `!ban @user [reason]` - Ban the user if their points drop below a certain threshold.
    - `!unban @user` - Unban a user, if they‚Äôve been banned but now met a set requirement (like point recovery).

---

### **Considerations:**

1. **Transparency:** Make sure that voting results and point deductions are clearly communicated. People should know why the punishment is happening and the steps involved.
    
2. **Abuse Prevention:** You may want to ensure there‚Äôs a **cooldown period** between voting attempts on a single user to prevent continuous targeting or abuse of the system.
    
3. **Fairness:** The voting system could use some moderation to prevent vote manipulation. For example, making sure that users can‚Äôt just vote in large groups against one person unfairly.
    
4. **Point Recovery:** Consider allowing users to **earn back** their points over time by demonstrating good behavior or completing certain tasks. This could encourage positive behavior.
    

---

### **Next Steps:**

- **Bot Development:** Start by integrating a **point tracking system** and then add the **voting functionality**.
- **Moderation Tools:** You could also add **logging** for each vote so there‚Äôs a record of the decisions made and why, especially if it involves banning someone.
- **Testing:** Ensure the bot functions well by testing it in a smaller environment first, to avoid any issues in larger servers.

This idea has the potential to create a more **community-driven moderation system**, where members feel more involved in keeping the environment safe and fun!

### **How to Exclude Inactive Users:**

1. **Track User Activity:**
    
    - You‚Äôll need to check if a user has sent any messages in the server before applying the point system or voting. You can do this by using a **message counter** for each user (you can track this in a database or memory store).
2. **Implementing the Check:**
    
    - **Before voting or point deduction:** Before initiating the voting or point deduction for a user, the bot should first check if the user has **sent any messages**. If they haven‚Äôt, it will **skip** the voting process or point deduction.
    - Example: If a user hasn't sent a message since joining the server or hasn‚Äôt been active in a certain amount of time (like a few days), the bot will ignore them in the vote system.
3. **Custom Commands or Alerts for Inactive Users:**
    
    - When admins/mods try to report or vote on an inactive user, you could add a message like: ‚Äú**This user has not been active enough to participate in the voting process**.‚Äù

---

### **Updated Commands:**

1. **Check Activity:**
    
    - `!isactive @user` - This could show whether the user is considered active based on their message history.
2. **Vote Command:**
    
    - Before initiating the vote, you can add a check like this:
        - "This user is not eligible for voting, as they haven‚Äôt participated in the server."
3. **Point System:**
    
    - `!points @user` will only display points for users who are active. For inactive users, you can just return a message like: "This user has no points since they haven't participated in any activity yet."

---

### **Logic Example:**

```python
# Pseudocode for checking activity before voting or point deduction
def is_user_active(user):
    # Check if user has sent a message in the last X hours or has any message count
    if user.message_count > 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

def start_vote(user):
    if is_user_active(user):
        # Proceed with the voting mechanism
        initiate_voting(user)
    else:
        send_message(f"{user.name} is not eligible for voting as they haven't been active.")
```


---

This ensures that **inactive users** (who haven‚Äôt participated in any messages) won‚Äôt be subject to the point system or voting, making it fair and preventing abuse of the system for users who are not engaging in the community.
